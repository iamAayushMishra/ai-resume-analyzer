# 📂 uploads

This folder is used by the application to store user-uploaded resume files and their processed outputs.

## 📌 Purpose
- **Incoming Resumes**: When a user uploads a resume PDF for analysis, it is saved here before processing.
- **Highlighted Resumes**: After analysis, the system generates a highlighted PDF showing matched keywords from the job description. These are also saved in this folder.


## ⚠️ Notes
- This folder is **automatically managed by the application** — you don’t need to manually add or remove files unless cleaning up.
- All files here are **temporary** and may be cleared periodically to save space.


## 🔒 Security
- Uploaded files should not be directly accessible via public URLs without proper authorization.
